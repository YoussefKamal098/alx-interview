def island_perimeter(grid):
    """
    Calculates the perimeter of an island represented by a grid of
    land and water.

    Args:
        grid (List[List[int]]): A 2D grid where 1 represents land and
            0 represents water. The grid is surrounded by water,
            and there is exactly one island or none.

    Returns:
        int: The perimeter of the island. If no land is present, returns 0.

    Example:
        grid = [
            [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
            [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
