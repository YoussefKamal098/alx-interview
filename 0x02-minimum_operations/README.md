### Problem Statement

You are given a number `n` representing the number of 'H' characters you want to achieve in a text file. Initially, there is a single 'H' in the file. You can perform only two operations on the text:
- **Copy All:** Copies all the characters currently in the file.
- **Paste:** Pastes the characters copied earlier.

Your task is to calculate the minimum number of operations needed to obtain exactly `n` 'H' characters in the file. If it's not possible to achieve `n` characters, return 0.

### Function Prototype

```python
def minOperations(n)
```

- **Parameters:**
  - `n`: An integer representing the number of 'H' characters to achieve.
  
- **Return Value:**
  - Returns an integer representing the minimum number of operations required to get exactly `n` characters.

### Solution Explanation

To find the minimum number of operations to reach exactly `n` 'H' characters, we can break down the problem using a **greedy approach**. The strategy is to focus on the prime factors of `n`, and use the minimum number of copy-paste operations based on the factorization of `n`.

#### 1. Problem Breakdown

- Start with 1 'H'.
- The only way to increase the number of 'H's is by copying the existing 'H's and pasting them.
- To minimize operations, we want to make large leaps in the number of 'H's by pasting as many as possible from previous copies.

#### 2. Greedy Approach

- The fewest operations correspond to decomposing `n` into its prime factors. Each time we encounter a factor, it represents the number of paste operations we need to perform after a "Copy All" operation.
  
- If `n` can be factorized as a product of prime numbers, then for each prime factor, we can perform the required number of paste operations. The total number of operations includes the number of pastes and the copy operations that precede them.

#### 3. Calculating Operations

- The idea is to repeatedly divide `n` by its smallest factors. For each division by a factor `f`, we add `f` to the total count of operations. This is because:
  - To get `f` repetitions of the current string length, we need `f-1` paste operations, plus one "Copy All" operation.

#### 4. Returning the Result

- After breaking down `n` by its prime factors, the sum of the factors represents the minimum number of operations needed.

### Example Usage

```python
# Testing the minOperations function
minOperations = __import__('0-minoperations').minOperations
n = 4
print(f"Min number of operations to reach {n} characters: {minOperations(n)}")  # Output: 4

n = 9
print(f"Min number of operations to reach {n} characters: {minOperations(n)}")  # Output: 6

n = 12
print(f"Min number of operations to reach {n} characters: {minOperations(n)}")  # Output: 7
```

### Detailed Walkthrough

#### Prime Factorization and Operations

The process of finding the minimum number of operations involves:
- **Prime Factorization**: Breaking `n` into its prime factors helps determine how many "Copy All" and "Paste" operations are needed. Each factor `f` represents `f-1` paste operations after copying the current content.

#### Looping Through Factors

The `minOperations` function works by checking divisibility by increasing factors starting from 2:
- For each factor, if `n` is divisible by the factor, we add the factor to the total count of operations and divide `n` by the factor.
- We continue this process until `n` becomes 1.

#### Summing the Operations

The total number of operations is the sum of the prime factors of `n`. Each prime factor contributes a number of operations equal to its value, reflecting the need to "Copy All" once and then "Paste" repeatedly to achieve the target number of 'H's.

---

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(sqrt(n))**, where `n` is the input number. This is because the algorithm checks for divisibility starting from 2 and goes up to the square root of `n`.

---

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is **O(1)**, as we only use a few variables to track the number of operations and factors.

---

### Edge Cases

#### 1. n is 1
If `n = 1`, no operations are needed, and the function should return 0.

#### 2. Large Prime Numbers
If `n` is a large prime number, the only way to achieve `n` 'H' characters is by performing one "Copy All" and `n-1` "Paste" operations, resulting in `n` operations.

This solution efficiently computes the minimum number of operations by leveraging prime factorization and a greedy approach to minimize unnecessary steps.
